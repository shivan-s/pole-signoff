# Pole Signoff

## Inspiration

I started pole in July 2023 and on the 6th December of the same year I attained level 2 and in order to celebrate I wanted to create this small concept application.

Usually sign off sheets are done by paper. As we know paper can be lost of destroyed, this is an attempt to digitise the process.

This is work-on-progress/concept. There are many things that don't work or aren't implemented. For example,

- Permissions
- Admin to set up moves
- No database
