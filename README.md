## Inspiration

I started pole in July 2023 and on the 6th of December of the same year, I attained level 2 and to celebrate I wanted to create this small concept application.

Usually sign-off sheets are done on paper. As we know paper can be lost or destroyed, this is an attempt to digitise the process.

This is work-in-progress/concept. Many things don't work or aren't implemented. For example,

- Permissions
- Admin to set up moves
- No database
